As a developer, I want to make at least three commits.
As a user, I want a destination to be randomly selected for my day trip.
As a user, I want a restaurant to be randomly selected for my day trip.
As a user, I want a mode of transportation to be randomly selected for my day trip.
As a user, I want a form of entertainment to be randomly selected for my day trip.
As a user, I want to be able to randomly re-select a destination, restaurant, mode of transportation, and/or form of entertainment if I don’t like one or more of those things.
As a user, I want to be able to confirm that my day trip is “complete” once I like all of the random selections.
As a user, I want to display my completed trip in the console.
As a developer, I want all of my functions to have a Single Responsibility. Remember, each function should do just one thing!
